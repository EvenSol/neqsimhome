## What is NeqSim?
NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production.
The basis for NeqSim is fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.  NeqSim is easilly extended with new methods. 

The original NeqSim web page is hosted at [NTNU](http://folk.ntnu.no/solbraa/neqsim/NeqSim.htm)

## NeqSim project in GitHub
The NeqSim library is written in the Java programming language. The source code and libraries are hosted in GitHub

* [NeqSim Java](https://github.com/equinor/neqsim)

## NeqSim toolboxes in GitHub
NeqSim toolboxes are avalable via GitHub for alternative programming languages.

* [NeqSim Matlab](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimmatlab)
* [NeqSim Python](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython)
* [NeqSim Python/Colab](https://github.com/EvenSol/NeqSim-Colab)

## Getting started
See the [NeqSim Java Wiki](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimsource/wiki) for how to use the NeqSim Java API. The NeqSim Matlab Wiki for how to use the [Matlab toolbox](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimmatlab/wiki).

## NeqSim web application
A [NeqSim web interface](http://129.241.62.72:8080/NeqSimServer3/faces/Login.jsp) has been developed to run calculation via a web interface. Calculations such as TPflash, dew points, phase envelopes and hydrate equilibrium evaluations can be run in the web application.
