## What is NeqSim?
[NeqSim](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a library for estimation of fluid behaviour for oil and gas production. NeqSim can be used as a stand-alone tool via Excel or a web interface. It is integrated in computer programs via available interfaces in Java, Python, .NET and Matlab. The basis for NeqSim is fundamental mathematical models related to phase behaviour and physical properties of oil and gas. NeqSim is available for free use and distributed as open source under the Apache-2.0 licence.

The original NeqSim web page is hosted at [NTNU](http://folk.ntnu.no/solbraa/neqsim/NeqSim.htm)

## NeqSim web application
A  web application has been developed to run calculation using neqsim via a web interface. Calculations such as TPflash, dew points, phase envelopes and hydrate equilibrium calculations can be run in the web application. An alternative web application is via Google Colab (Python).
