## What is NeqSim?
NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production.
The basis for NeqSim is fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.  NeqSim is easilly extended with new methods. 



The original NeqSim web page is hosted at [NTNU](http://folk.ntnu.no/solbraa/neqsim/NeqSim.htm)

## NeqSim project in GitHub
The NeqSim library is written in the Java programming language. The source code and library releases are hosted in GitHub
