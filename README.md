## What is NeqSim?
NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production.
The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.  NeqSim is easilly extended with new method. 



The original NeqSim web page is hosted at [NTNU](http://folk.ntnu.no/solbraa/neqsim/NeqSim.htm)

## The NeqSim project
The NeqSim library is written in the Java programming language. The source code and java libraries can be downloaded from [the NeqSim Java repository](https://github.com/equinor/neqsim)

## NeqSim toolboxes
NeqSim toolboxes are avalable via GitHub for alternative programming languages. See the project wiki pages for how to use the tools.
