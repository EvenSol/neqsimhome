# NeqSim
NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production.
The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.  NeqSim is easilly extended with new method.

## NeqSim Projects
NeqSim toolboxes are avalable via GitHub for alternative programming languages. See the project wiki pages for how to use the tools.
